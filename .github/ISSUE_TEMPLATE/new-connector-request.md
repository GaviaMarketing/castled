We accept and love contributions! 
Adding connectors in Castled is very easy if you have some experience in Java. Our docs have some information on the process. Also, connect with us on our Discord server if you need help in getting started with contributing code.
Perfectly okay if you don't have any intentions of contributing. 
We really appreciate your connector request :-)
